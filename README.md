# MIPS

These are the two MIPS assembly programming assignments from CDA3101 Introduction to Computer Organization. Essentially,
we were provided an algorithm in pseudocode and were asked to translate it into the MIPS assembly language. In HW1, we
created a palindrome detector that determines whether or not a number is a palindrome or not. In HW2, we were asked to
create Greatest Common Denominator and Least Common Multiple functions.
